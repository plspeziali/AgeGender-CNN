\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusions}
In this study, we have presented a comparison between two CNN
architectures for the recognition of biometric characteristics,
specifically age and gender, from facial images.

As we can observe, both through metrics and graphical representations,
maintaining the same basic structure in both the single-task and multi-task
architectures yields remarkably similar results.
The distinction between the two models is largely attributed to the
inherent randomness introduced during the model training process.

Nevertheless, it's important to note that the findings of this study
are not universally applicable and may vary when altering the
structure of the architectures, hyperparameters, or dataset.
