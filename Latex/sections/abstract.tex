This study conducts a comparative analysis between a multi-task
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and two single-task CNNs for
age and perceived gender detection in facial images, aiming to evaluate their
performance and differences in task execution.
The two single-task CNNs were designed with identical structures,
differing only in the final part: one for age prediction and another
for gender classification. The multi-task CNN incorporated a branching
mechanism for both tasks, utilizing a shared loss function for backpropagation.
Evaluation metrics included R-squared score for age prediction,
accuracy for gender
classification, and visualization of mean heatmaps to discern disparities in
the attention of convolutional layers. Results indicate that there are no
significant differences in performance between the multi-task CNN and the
single-task CNNs, suggesting comparable efficacy in gender and age prediction
tasks.
